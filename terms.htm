<h1>Terms and conditions of business</h1><br>
<p>I am a Herbalist and I have a diploma in Herbal medicine. My business is insured and both certificates are available to view on my instagram.</p>
<p>I sell natural products which are pure and so I don't have a returns policy for them.If someone is able to prove that any of my products are not pure via a lab test then they may return the product and they will receive the full payment.My company will also pay for the lab test when we are informed how much it will cost as long as we are given the results.This has never happened before in the 6 years that I have been trading.</p>
<p>I do treatment for various ailments such as anxiety, sleeping problems, body pain, weak eyesight, cholesterol, high blood pressure and a general package for strength or energy.I only charge for the treatment package and we agree an amount of donation to be given to me when you are better. If you don't get better I expect no donation from you.</p>
<p>The other services that our provided in the shop are by my colleague Mahmoud. You may contact him regarding his treatment or treatment plans.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Omar ansari</p> <br><br><br><br>

<h2>Postal service for UK</h2><br>

<p>I have been posting parcels to different parts of UK. It's my responsibility to make sure the parcel reaches you. Minimum order is GBP20.Postage and packaging is seperate.I usually charge between GBP3 to GBP9 per order and I tell people how much the cost is when they make the order.When I receive the payment for your parcel I send your parcel informing you when it will reach you approximately.If you order Olive oil or Rapeseed oil then I will send it to you in plastic bottles so it is safer. I prefer people contact me on 0730577190 between 10am to 3pm if they want a postal order.This is so I can get the order ready, packed and sent to the post office by 5pm.People can contact me at other times to make an order and if im free i will take the order or I will contact them the next day. I take bank transfer.</p>

<p>Thank you Omar</p>
