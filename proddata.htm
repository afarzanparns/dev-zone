<h3>About shilagit</h3><br><br>
<p>A superfood, shilagit is a natural substance containing more than 80 minerals. A combination of shilagit with warm water or milk can relieve a hundred health issues. You'll get 15 doses out of this packet and two doses are recommended every week. Shilagit enhances fertility in men and women. It increases blood circulation to the heart and removes blockages from the body.</p><br><br><br>

<h3>Yoga mat</h3><br><br>
<p>The yoga mats I sell come in 5 colours and are cheaper than the normal retail price. They can be used for prayer or other exercises besides yoga.</p><br><br><br>

<h3>Pink salt</h3><br><br>
<p>I advise people to have this instead of white salt. You can sprinkle half a teaspoon in your food when you are cooking. Also you can fill the bathtub with hot water and add a cup of pink salt to it. This is good to remove negative energy, body pain or stress.Pink salt or Himalayan salt contain more than 80 minerals which aren't in normal salt.</p><br><br><br>

<h3>Miswak</h3><br><br>
<p>This is a natural toothbrush which is used by dentists and people all over the world. It can be used for 1 month and then thrown away. It should be kept in the bedroom and used and then put back in the bedroom. It has many benefits such as strengthening the teeth, the gums, increases memory, removes spots, helps digestion and strengthens back.It can be used with or without toothpaste.The Miswak is normally used after meals and the first thing in the morning. For more information on this product you may Google Miswak.</p><br><br><br>

<h3>The golden burner</h3><br><br>
<p>I sell other burners for GBP12.00 but this one is the best one I sell.Recommended to burn Frankincense, Oudh or Bakhour after it gets dark.This is good for the soul and removes negative energy from a house.</p><br><br><br>

<h3>Essential oils 6 pack</h3><br><br>
<p>I've only got a few left of this so it's good to get them now as I may not have these available in the future.Theres a picture on my instagram of the 6 oils that come in the box. Smell nice and have a cheap price .</p><br><br><br>

<h3>Camels hump oil</h3><br><br>
<p>This is one of my best products which I use myself. Since I've been selling it I'm hearing good feedback from customers. People spend hundreds of pounds on their skin or their appearance whereas I sell this only for GBP20.00.</p> <br><br><br>

<h3>Argan oil</h3><br><br>
<p>This oil is only available from Morroco and is good for skin and hair. The one I sell can be drunk. </p><br><br><br>

<h3>Rapeseed oil</h3><br><br>
<p>This is an oil which I've done prayers on and is used as a massage oil.It removes pain, negative energy and can be used on people of all ages.Apply it at night on the body for maximum benefits and leave it for as long as you can.Ive been selling this for 6 years and this is one of my special products.</p> <br><br><br>
