If you’re interested in picking up a new gaming mouse or keyboard, then you may want to make sure you’re clued in on the polling rate.
We’re going to be running through what a polling rate is, so you know which type of peripheral you should be choosing.
What is a polling rate?
The polling rate measures how often a device (typically a gaming mouse or keyboard) reports its position back to the computer it’s paired up to. This is measured in Hz, with a higher number generally seeing a shorter delay.
A mouse with a higher polling rate can help decrease the lag between moving your mouse in real life and waiting for the cursor to move on the screen. A higher polling rate will be better suited to gamers who need to take quick actions within their game, such as a competitive shooter where reaction times are so important. However, a higher polling rate will also use up more CPU resources, as the CPU has to check in with the mouse more often.
There are multiple options when it comes to polling rate, with the lower polling rate mice seeing a greater delay. We have tabled the total delay at the common polling rates below.
The lowest mouse polling rate on the table is 125Hz and 125Hz leads to the longest total delay on the table which is 8ms.

Okay, so ... here's the deal, Bamm. Chris Geo started this station some years ago when there was an upsurge in development of new "truthers" in the world. Although newbies continue to enter the alleged sphere of connected truther communities, Chris Geo and his wife are mainly doing their own thing and earning some revenue from the few clients who continue to pay for their ongoing ads on the station. Chris Geo mostly handles all the chores of running the station by himself. But, I love Chris Geo like a bro who I rarely communicate with, he seriously needs to hire a Marketing professional to manage the commercial spots. A marketing professional who does that will earn money for the station which he can use to fix all the problems.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Allen_(song)
"Barbara Allen" (Child 84, Roud 54) is a traditional folk song that is popular throughout the English-speaking world and beyond. It tells of how the eponymous character denies a dying man's love, then dies of grief soon after his untimely death.

The song began as a ballad in the seventeenth century or earlier, before quickly spreading (both orally and in print) throughout Britain and Ireland and later North America.[1][2][3] Ethnomusicologists Steve Roud and Julia Bishop described it as "far and away the most widely collected song in the English language—equally popular in England, Scotland and Ireland, and with hundreds of versions collected over the years in North America."[4]

As with most folk songs, "Barbara Allen" has been published and performed under many different titles, including "The Ballet of Barbara Allen", "Barbara Allen's Cruelty", "Barbarous Ellen",[5] "Edelin", "Hard Hearted Barbary Ellen", "Sad Ballet Of Little Johnnie Green", "Sir John Graham", "Bonny Barbara Allan", "Barbry Allen" among others.
