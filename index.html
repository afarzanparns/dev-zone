<p>Review from a young male<br />'Omar has helped me mentally and physically using organic products and the energy healing that he does. I was lost in life and I have now stopped weed. Looking at his shop and just talking to him has helped me clear my mind of negative thoughts. I will go to his shop once a week.'</p>

<p>Review from an English lady<br />'I went to see my consultant in the hospital about my eyes. He asked me what I've been using as my eyes look a lot better. He had never heard of blackseed oil so he said to me carry on what you're doing. Also my little girl had really dry skin so I used the olive oil that I got from you on her. I checked on her in the morning and it was all cleared up.<br />This is thanks to you.'</p>
