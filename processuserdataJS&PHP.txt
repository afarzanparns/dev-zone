How to create a form in html
To create a form in html, you need to use the <form> tag with some attributes and nested elements. The most important attributes are    action   and   method   .  The   action    attribute specifies the url of the php script that shall handle the form data. The   method   attribute specifies the http method that shall be used to send the form data. There are two methods -   get   and   post   .

The   post   method sends the form data in the body of the http request. Unlike   get   , the url will not change but the form data will be hidden from the user and the browser.

The nested elements of the form tag are the form controls that allow users to enter or select data. There are different types of form controls, such as
<input>
<textarea>
<select>
<button> , etc.   Each form control has a   name   attribute that identifies it in the form data.  Some form controls also have a   value   attribute that specifies their default or current value.
Here is an example of a simple html form that uses the   post   method and has two input fields - name and email


<form action = 'nameofmyform.php' method = 'post'>
  <p>Name:  <input type = 'text' name = 'name> </p>
  <p>Email: <input type = 'email' name = 'email'></p>
  <p><input type = 'submit' value = 'Submit'> </p>
</form>
