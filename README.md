Decades of academic learning in programming and computer science impel me to work in IT, essentially for the love of IT
In 2008-09 i created a website for a nonprofit local lecture club, advising both members and general public of our forthcoming lectures,
plus recording a list of past events.
This was created using Photoshop 7.0 and HTML and i had not come across CSS by 2009. Neither was JavaScript required for that project.

2023-24 i agreed to create website for pal that runs his business. He sells his products and services and therefore 
this assignment requires mastery of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and use of PHP, even SQL.

This information better than nothing, of course!
